QAP 2 exercise 2
Stephen Squire
Design a solution to a business problem and work out the database to store the information.

    The church hall sunday craft and bake sale wants to start tracking both the number of people 
who attended the sale and the traffic at each table in the hall. With this information, they hope to 
be able to balance out the appearance of the most popular tables across the year, thus stimulating
increased traffic week after week.
    This will  require a database with a table entity for each table that visits the hall, a table entity to track each 
weeks traffic for each table, and a table entity to represent each sale event. The three tables are required 
because the relationship between the weekly_sale_table and the table_table is many to many. In order to 
place this in a database in a normalized manner we need to introduce a bridge table that creates two one 
to many relationships in the place of the many to many relationship. 

1. weekly_sale_table
    -- sale_id
    -- sale_date
    -- attendee_count
    
2. table_table
    -- table_id
    -- vendor_name
    -- vendor_email

3.  weekly_table_traffic_table
    -- table_id
    -- sale_id
    -- table_traffic
