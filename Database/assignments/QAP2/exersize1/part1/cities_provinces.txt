exercise 1 part 1 - cities in provinces

    This problem of tables to link the cities to the provinces is an example of a 
one-to-many (1-M) relationship. To represent this in a normalized database we will
have to include the foreign key of one table in the other table

The two tables (entities) are:

1. cities   - table name is city_table
                - city_id - a unique id for each city_id
                - city_name - the name of the city, var char(32?)
                - theres so many more potential attributes for this table
                    ^^ population, gdp, growth rate, latitude, longitude, etc.
                - a foreign key from the province_table to show which province
                    the city is in

2. provinces - table name is province_table
                    - province_id - a unique id for each province
                    - province_name - the name of the province, var char(32?)
                    - theres so many more potential attributes for this table
                        ^^ population, gdp, growth rate, land mass, etc.

    This is a 1-M relationship because while there are many cities and many provinces, only 
a province may have many cities in it. A city may not be in many provinces. A view showing 
all the cities in a province could be competed by using a where clause to filter the cities table
by province_id. The tables could also be joined on this id. Such joins could be used along with
attributes for each table if implemented, such as population, to create views of statistics like 
percent population of the province found in any city.  Given that we were only asked for these 
two entities and the necessary components to display their relationship such examples are only 
hypothetical at this time.
