exercise 1 part 3 - Monthly Publication Usage

    This publication usage tracking database will require 2 tables. One to represent the publications
and another to represent the usage.

the publication table will have publication id, title, last rev date, and potentially many more attributes.

The usage table will have a usage code (like those in the example jan02Use) coupled to a publication id
as a composite primary key. it will also have attributes related to the usage, such as usage count, 
unique users, etc.

This is a one to many relationship. each publication will relate to many usage table entities. Each usage 
table will relate back to only one publication.
