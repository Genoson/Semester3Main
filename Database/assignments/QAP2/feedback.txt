feedback questions answers for QAP2

1. This QAP took me about 5 hours to complete. I estimate I spent about 45 minutes
on each part of this QAP. 5 x 45 = 225 minutes on exercise 1 and an additional 45 minutes
on exercise 2. 

2. For this assignment i used no online resources. I just read the instructions and worked through
the assignment. Prior to this assignment I had used the textbook, lecture materials and the internet
to study and practice this content.

3. I asked for no help from my peers.

4. I asked you, Peter, for a few pieces of clarification on the specifics of the  expected submission content.

5. This was a fairly easy QAP from a difficulty stand point. 3/10.
    It was however a large body of work that required reading and assessing what was being asked, 
and attacking each problem in a manner to reduce unnecessary work. Several of the problems in 
exercise 1 could have taken up a considerably larger span of time had I opted to develop out the 
robustness and functionality of the tables and databases. Similarly, exercise 2 if choosing a complex
business scenario could easily snowball into a near insurmountable task, hence I chose a small, practical  
problem.
