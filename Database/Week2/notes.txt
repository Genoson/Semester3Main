PostgreSQL select Notes

SELECT statement in sql is used to retrieve data from a database.
- has many clauses to generate flexible queries
including:
- SELECT - which columns to return
- FROM - which table to select from
- WHERE - which rows to return
- GROUP BY - which columns to group by
- HAVING - which rows to return
- ORDER BY - which columns to order by
- LIMIT - how many rows to return
- DISTINCT - which columns to return distinct values for
- FETCH - how many rows to return
- JOIN - how to join tables, has many sub categories
- UNION - how to combine queries, also INTERSECT and EXCEPT

SELECT * FROM table_name;
^^ would return all rows from table_name

SQL statements tend to be evaluated from the end to the beginning.

single quotes can be used for expressional queries
ie:
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name FROM employees;

Wednesday class notes

Most SQL database managers are very similar. PostgreSQL is open source so a great learning resource.

SELECT * FROM table_name;
^ would return all rows from table_name

SELECT first_name FROM table_name WHERE last_name IN ('Smith', 'Jones');
select the item first names where the last name is in the set of Smith and Jones

SELECT first_name FROM table_name WHERE last_name IN ('Smith', 'Jones') AND ...;
SELECT first_name FROM table_name WHERE last_name IN ('Smith', 'Jones') OR ...;
can use logical arguments and and or in the WHERE clause to refine results

order of operations inside SQL exists and will be studied later this semester

SELECT customer_id, Sum(amount) FROM invoices GROUP BY customer_id;

ORDER BY will sort the results by the column specified
you can also use DESC to sort in descending order

Sum() is a function that will return the sum of the column specified
you can call the result as sum in ORDER BY etc to sort by the sum

JOIN is a way to combine tables
INNER JOIN - only returns rows that are in both tables
LEFT JOIN - returns rows from the left table even if they don't have a match in the right table
RIGHT JOIN - returns rows from the right table even if they don't have a match in the left table
FULL JOIN - returns rows from both tables even if they don't have a match in the other table

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name full_name, Sum(amount) amount 
FROM payment
INNER JOIN customer USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY full_name
ORDER BY amount DESC

AS can be used to create aliases for columns

LIKE clause can be used to search for a pattern in a column
there are two wildcards: % and _
other pattern matching operators:
- | - matches any one character
- ^ - matches the start of a string
- $ - matches the end of a string

Thursday lecture notes

A lot of professional database engineers will work exclusively with the CLI (command line interface)
Anything the GUI can do the CLI can do as well

-- will be used to comment out SQL statements

you can modify database values directly inside pgadmin 4. remember to save any changes you make.

ORDER BY can take multiple, comma seperated arguments, performing them in the order specified

in command line the ; terminator is necessary to end a statement
in the query tool in the gui it is optional

default scripts for insert and update and other statements are provided

CRUD
CREATE = SQL INSERT 
READ = SQL SELECT
UPDATE = SQL UPDATE
DELETE = SQL DELETE -- not used much, very powerful and dangerous, hard to recover data, not recommended
