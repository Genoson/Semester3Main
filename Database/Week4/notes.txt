Normalization and the normal forms of database design

how often is it required to exceed the 3NF (3rd normal form)?

Mockaroo.com is a tool for generating mock data for testing and development.
we will be using it extensively in this course.

the DISTINCT clause in SQL allows to filter out duplicate rows.

To avoid the mockaroo data duplication, we can the DISTINCT clause
and a Select Into statement.

In database design the customers viewpoint is a great way to look at the data.

Leading off with a discussion of the QAP

-JOIN was a common issue

-GROUP BY needs to work with an aggregate function... 
^^hence my bonus problem being incomplete

- avoid special characters in table or field names

- to illustrate a JOIN we should select from both sides of the JOIN

Back to discussion of Normalization
most normalization problems are solved by creating a new table to decompose the 
problem data into smaller pieces.

1NF (1st normal form) - the simplest form of database design
- no duplicate primary keys
- unique column names
- no column can have a table as a value (no multivalued attributes)


2NF (2nd normal form) - the next step of Normalization
- 1NF is achieved
- uhh, buddy its hard to explain these in plain english


3NF (3rd normal form) - the standard level of database normalization
- 2NF is achieved
- every non prime attribute is non transitively dependent on every key 
- every non key attribute has to provide a fact about the key
