Going to build a database about people and their cloths

When building a database 
you will need a sample of the data to work with
this sample will allow the basic layout and domain of the data to be designed
Need to determine/ generate unique identifiers for each row of each table

Can use the gui, query tool or the commands line

DROP DATABASE "database name"
^^ will delete the database

you can change the setting on a database to be able to omit the schema name
challenge from Peter to figure this out...

schemas are like sub databases in a database

uniqueness rules can be put in place to prevent multiple rows from having the same value


1-M relationships are one to many
they are defined by a foreign key


QAP for database should be posted today, it was
1. screenshot of command line execution
    screenshot of database metrics

2. demonstrate select statement capabilities
    demonstrate where clause
    demonstrate group by clause
    demonstrate order by clause
    demonstrate the join clause
    BONUS: use only one SQL to accomplish this
    submit as a .sql file

3. CRUD
    demonstrate insert statement
    demonstrate update statement
    demonstrate delete statement
    
    submit as a .sql file

4. CREATE DATABASE
    demonstrate create database statement
    at least 2 tables with relationships
    submit as a .sql file
