Going to build a database about people and their cloths

When building a database 
you will need a sample of the data to work with
this sample will allow the basic layout and domain of the data to be designed
Need to determine/ generate unique identifiers for each row of each table

Can use the gui, query tool or the commands line

DROP DATABASE "database name"
^^ will delete the database

you can change the setting on a database to be able to omit the schema name
challenge from Peter to figure this out...

schemas are like sub databases in a database

uniqueness rules can be put in place to prevent multiple rows from having the same value


1-M relationships are one to many
they are defined by a foreign key
