Script for my "to market" portion of the blockchain presentation.

"Hi, Stephen Squire speaking, he/him, from St. John's, Nl.

In order to bring our blockchain based solution to product label changes to market there
are several hurdles to overcome.

First and foremost among them will be in getting the industry and regulatory body to adopt 
a digital ID system. Use of a standard digital  ID system is integral to streamlining the process
of using blockchain technologies. An education initiative will be needed to get the various 
players on board. Proof of the value proposition will go along way towards getting the industry
to adopt blockchain.

After the adoption of the blockchain solution a second educational initiative will be required
for the consumers and retailers. Labels using the new system would be able to receive updates
quickly and perhaps more frequently than product stock might rotate off of shelves or out of 
cupboards. By placing a QR code on products and educating consumers and retailers on the use
of this code, the most recent product information and history of updates to the product will always
be available."
