This week starting feb 14, 2022
we will be continuing to develop our linked list understanding and code base

example of a linked list worked this week

deleting all even numbers from a linked list is the first example

// finally did the recursion chapter in order, about a month after it was brought up
in a recursive system we can use a map (memo) to store the results of previous calls
in doing this we can reduce the computational time of the algorithm


we are going to implement a double link list with search and sort
perhaps with a ui and a search bar to input the search parameters
we will need to sort the list as well to prevent duplication
use sets to prevent duplication
