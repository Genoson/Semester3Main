This is the last week of classes before the final sprint. 

Hopefully Kennedy gives indication of the problem we will have to solve in the final sprint.


this week we will look at some search and sort algorithms

Binary search tree will be on the sprint


the upcoming sprint has an individual and a group component

- individual component will be the binary tree
^^ - we just need to use the given binary tree from class and make it work for the code
^^ - we won't need custom methods  
^^ - we need to traverse the tree and output a JSON representation of the tree

We will need to implement a search engine as well
^^ searching the database
