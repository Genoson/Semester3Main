Notes for Kennedys' course, monday january 17th, 2022

Recursion - a function that calls itself
    - common recursive methods include
        - factorial
        - fibonacci
        - binary search
        - merge sort
        - quick sort
        - etc.

    - recursive functions are often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems


Recursive Logic
1 method calls itself
2 exit the infinite loop at some condition

Recursion is a relatively slow method, if resource use matters consider other methods

recursive functions follow these steps
1. find the flow 
2. the stopping criteria
3. adding edge cases

Assignment - being posted after class

coming classes we get into big 0 notation,
time complexity and space complexity

next week we get to stacks and queues

Lecture January 18, 2022
Big O notation

Upcoming assignment will be cumulative of arrays, recursion and big "0" notation

Kennedy stress's rigorous code testing and in depth planning when writing code.
Bad code that works on your system may not work elsewhere and can cause real issues
if pushed into real projects. 
Design, Refine, Code


Big 0 is a way to describe the time and space complexity of a function
how long it will take to run and how much space it takes up while doing it

will we be looking at generalizations as a measure.
ie: linear is better than quadratic as far as time and space complexity is concerned

types of big(0)
0(1) - constant time
0(n) - linear time
0(n^2) - quadratic time
0(n^n) - exponential time
0(log n) - logarithmic time
polynomial time - 0(n^k)
poly logarithmic time - 0(n log n)
... and more

assignment and other one off tasks are O(1), constant time
