this is either week 7 or week 9 depending on if we count the sprint weeks or not


This class is to address the classes issues with the topic of double linked lists. 
It is now purely a review class. what a waste of time.

Sets as a data structure were referenced but we will go no deeper into them unless we have time at the end
of the semester
