This first lecture, monday jan 31,  we will look at queues
My code from the textbook is located in week3 folder

so far we have covered :
arrays
stacks
recursive methods
big(0) notation


Queues are a data structure that are first in first out, FIFO

We add to the tail and remove from the head

Queue methods:
enqueue(item)
dequeue()
peek()
isEmpty()
size()
clear()
toString()

Tuesday feb 1 class notes.

Kennedy is trying to get us working on a problem together
// example problem to solve today
// Given a queue which consists of the first n natural numbers, 
// these are in random order
// the task is to check whether the given queue can be sorted into another queue
// 
We could take the first number from the queue and place it in the stack
then take the next number and compare it to the top of the stack
if this number is larger than the number on the stack we pop out the stack value
into a temporary variable and push in the new number
we would set this interaction into a recursive function 
such that the stack could sort all the way to the bottom
and iterate thru all the numbers in the queue, this generating a sorted stack, 
then pop the stack into the queue to generate the sorted queue

solution is in problem.js file
