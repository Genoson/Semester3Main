// notes on stacks and queues
// stacks js file is in week 2 folder

//stacks are last in first out, LIFO
// first lecture of this week was spent on stack structure and logic

this is the second lecture of the week, we will be getting into queues

but first we will use a stack in an example:
in this example we begin by considering how a number is converted to binary
floating point number to binary:
ok, he did an integer to binary conversion
Kennedy says decimal number to mean base 10 not having a decimal point
we will use a stack to hold the remainders of the division
