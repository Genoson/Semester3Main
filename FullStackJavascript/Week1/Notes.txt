common node modules and the require command

path module - node.js
accessed by:
const path = require('path');
has many methods

os module - node.js
accessed by:
const os = require('os');
has many methods


file system module - node.js
accessed by:
const fs = require('fs');
has many methods
sync vs async methods exist for each method
async methods are to be used unless you explicitly know you need the sync method

events module - node.js
accessed by:
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
events is a class, therefore an object of that class must be created, as shown above.
has many methods
requires a listener to be added to the event emitter
emitter.on('event', (arg)=>{
    //do something
});
and events to be emitted
emitter.emit('event');
event arguments can be passed to the event and then further used in the listener

events are often used to communicate between modules. 

in practice we rarely use the emitter object directly but instead create a class that inherits from it

http module - node.js
accessed by:
const http = require('http');
has many methods
