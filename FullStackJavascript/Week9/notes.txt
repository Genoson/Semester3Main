For the next 2 weeks up to the next qap we will be working on fleshing out
our full stack capabilities.

the upcoming QAP and sprint will be unified into a cumulative assignment.

building a data access layer


full stack:

presentation layer - front end, ui/ux
router layer - api
service layer - business logic
data access layer - database



view engines handle the front end
---> model view and controller

pug, nunjucks, handlebars, ejs, jade etc

ejs is the most popular view engine and the most javascript like

ejs will by default look in the views folder for .ejs files


we are doing both courses as a unified front

when you save a view in the database it can be queried like normal without 
needing to know the full select statement. views can't be used to add or remove data.


for qap3 we have to build a data access layer against the dvd rentals database

module we will use:
npm install pg ejs express
