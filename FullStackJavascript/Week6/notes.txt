This weeks focus is on async programming and datastreams

We will start with a rehash of the event loop
Notes on the video: What the heck is th eevent loop anywasy?

heap is a data structure that stores data in a way that allows us to quickly find 
the smallest or largest element in the heap

call stack is a data structure that stores the functions that are currently being
executed


the call stack
^=> single threaded = one function at a time
^=> keeps track of what we are doing and what needs to be done
^=> the call stack has a maximum size

some functions are blocking, they take a long time to execute
blocking is a problem because in a single threaded program, the call stack is
full and we can't do anything else. ie, the browser will appear frozen

Friday to Friday for the Sprint, due midnight the 25th of february
It will be a team based sprint
3 or 4 people will be working on the sprint
randomly assigned

we will have to use async programming for the sprint, especially in the file system.
use fs.promises... pete likes an alias for fs.promises but not necessary
pay attention to proper use of async compute 
ensure code handles all cases

This project is like, all over the place and hardly sensical in its pre presentation state
^^ starting to make more sense now, thanks be to jesus :)

We will need to create an app that we interact with via commands in the terminal
it should log what we are doing and access the file system
It might also interact with kennedy's course, ie we could be using his doubly link list as the
data structure for the cli program

use a switch to process the arguments passed into the command line, like the 
html server but all locally hosted

for the switch, the default case should be a catch all that prints out the help and 
a few other basic commands to get teh user on the right track


after the sprint we will get into the symbolic debugger, we should already know this, lol

will need a secondary switch to handle the deeper arguments

ie: node app --help --helpMore

lots fo testing and debugging

token generation, one way, not quite a hashing algorithm


Sprint to contain a database of 10-15 tables
^^ fully normalized, including several views of the data


implement a doubly linked list from a json file describing a user and including a token

searchable, hashing? indexing? 

user tokens should include:
created
username
token
email
phone
expires
confirmed
^^ use template literals to allow variable information to tbe fed to the JSON parser



** optional code **
write a function to search the token, identify expired tokens, and delete them
^^ create an index of the tokens by expires and compare to the current datetime

Look up the inquirer module
