QAP 3 Post assignment evaluation 

1. This assignment took me ~ 3 hours to complete. I might take the time to attack the 3rd story and 
further refine the stylesheet given the extension, in which case I will be closer to 4 hours.

2. I used your lectures, and online resources.

3. I did not ask for any help from my peers.

4. I did not ask for any help from my instructors

5. This was a particularly simple QAP given that you, Peter, had essentially already done the assignment for us.
Refining the queries to generate views with minimal data  was probably the most difficult part of the assignment.
Followed closely by getting used to reading ejs code with those <% %> tags that were breaking my code reading
flow at first. I would give this one 3/10 overall for difficulty.
