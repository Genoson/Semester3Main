// starting with the event emitter today
// many javascript libraries have event emitter
// the event emitter is a class
we use the event emitter to create events based around certain actions. 
these can be custom or built into functions and modules

we often used the events in dom manipulation last semester
for example on a form submission we would create an event
and then access the values of the form by using the event.target.value

there are pretty well unlimited applications for events and event emitters

for our QAP we will have to build a website server and log all the events 
then write all of those logs to a file

Peter wants us to use the exports and require to create a module to better
organize our code, and to make it easier to use and read

Thursday feb 4 2022 lecture notes

!! don't add features that aren't in the specification !!
that's working for free and impacts code performance

refactoring is reworking the code to make it more efficient, cleaner, easier to read
no added functionality just revision and editting

more event emitter stuff, and a discussion on the upcoming assignment and what will be expected

*****************
start putting headers on files to describe what they do and who wrote them

distinction requiremenets:
1.
more than 6 routes. a valid redirect. and cookies- set some cookies

2.
root landing page was links to other pages. use at least 5 http status codes, respond to these accordingly

3.
use multiple events and listeners, handle them and log them well
