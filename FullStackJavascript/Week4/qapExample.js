// building a logging to disk system to monitor a server
// index, logEvents, routes, server js files working together

// index.js file will import the routes module/ js file
//^^ will need to create the pages for the website. something nice :)

// routes.js file will contain a series of functions that will be called by the server to log 
// the events to of the routes

// Peters example runs teh works of it from one file.
//
// challenge myself to encorporate a Queue to hold the messages to be written to the log file.

// requires an understanding of http server

// write your own code. dont just copy and paste
// make it unique to you

// to use the emitter as intended
// create a new event emitter that extends the event emitter class
// create a new instance of the event emitter
//use an event listener to listen for the event and pass in the message
// include info on the date/time, route, status code in the message
