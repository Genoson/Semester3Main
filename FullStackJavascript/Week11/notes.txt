method-overide library for update and delete operations on a database and
perhaps some mongoDB

Might get into react integrations as well


Put vs Patch methods

Get will find data

put will update data
patch is like put but sends instructions to update not the updated data

delete will delete data

post will create data


important to view the req object and find the data you are planning on using

remember to get the data layer working as a seperate entity. Dont build too
many things at once, nightmare for troubleshooting
