associated concepts
incorporating github and cloud concepts into our tech stack
how automated testing fits into this stack

writing software that tests your code

testing is a career path in its own right
testers typically oversee code from a team or teams of developers
testers rarely fix the problems that they find

test driven development builds the tests and then writes code that passes them


types of testing

manual testing
automated testing
performance testing
security testing

black box testing testing blind to the internals of the code

white box testing involves knowing the internals of the code

^^ testing the edge cases that could break the code
